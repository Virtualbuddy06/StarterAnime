    <p>One Punch Man (ワンパンマン), one of the most popular anime especially among foreign anime fans, is perfect for anime
        newcomers. The action and comedy anime is based on the manga which started to be published from 2009 and
        serialized with over 20 volumes.</p>
    <p>The main character superhero named Saitama who never looks cool but can beat any enemy with a single punch.
        However strong the monsters and villains are, he defeats them with only one punch. What is funny is that he
        obtains the power by just training hard.</p>
    <p>Not only Saitama but other cool and unique characters including his disciple Genos and the expert martial artist
        Bang are featured on One Punch Man. Enjoy the mixture of Japanese comedy with the American superhero’s essence.
