    <p>It was a given that this series would be on this list. Death Note is a classic and the first anime many people
        watch, for good reason. It’s an insane supernatural crime thriller with about as many twists and turns as you
        could fathom.</p>
    <p>gist is this: one day a bored death god drops a book with the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it
        onto Earth. A high school student (and son of a police officer) named Light picks it up, speed runs a
        god-complex, and decides to use it to fix the world. Stumped at the string of unexplainable suspicious deaths,
        the police bring in L, the world’s best detective. Shenanigans ensue.</p>

    <p>Death Note is mind-game central. It’s a lot of internal monologuing about genius schemes but it’s done so well
        that it will make you pause the show and run laps around your house to calm down. This show has everything:
        political commentary, battles between serial killers and detectives, potato chips, cursed objects, supermodels,
        and more. It is absolutely worthy of being your first anime. You can find Death Note on streamers such as Hulu,
        Netflix, among others.</p>
